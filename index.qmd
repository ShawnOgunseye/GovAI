This book provides a comprehensive guide to AI governance for practitioners building and managing governance programs in organizations. It covers foundational concepts, legal and regulatory frameworks, governance across the AI lifecycle, multiple organizational perspectives, and emerging topics where the field continues to evolve.

The book takes a "governance first" approach, recognizing that governance foundations should precede large-scale AI adoption. It builds understanding systematically from foundational concepts through practical implementation, with worked examples, professional figures, and practical templates.

## About This Book {.unnumbered}

Each chapter follows a consistent structure: an opening that situates the material, substantive prose explaining core concepts and their relationships, worked examples that demonstrate application, and end-of-chapter review questions that reinforce learning. Templates and detailed checklists appear in the appendices.

**A note on legal and regulatory content:** AI governance operates within a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape. This book describes requirements and frameworks as they exist at the time of writing, but readers should verify current requirements in their jurisdictions.

## How to Use This Book {.unnumbered}

**If you have limited time**, focus on Chapters 1 and 2 to understand foundational concepts and the regulatory landscape, then proceed to Chapter 5 on governance by design.

**For comprehensive learning**, read all chapters in sequence and work through the practice scenarios in Appendix C.

**For practitioners**, the appendix templates and worked examples provide starting points for organizational adaptation.
